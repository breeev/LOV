## What?
LOV. This is a lighter Blip interpreter designed to send midi messages to a file or a local (virtual) loopback MIDI device like <a href="https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html">LoopMIDI</a>. These messages can then be used by a sound system built in Python, Pure-Data or just any MIDI player or editor to play, shape sounds and instruments, or edit songs.
