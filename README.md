# L.O.V.
My advanced MML inspired golfing language (in progress): Lengh, Octave, Velocity / Volume

## What?
LOV. This is a lighter Blip interpreter designed to send midi messages to a file or a local (virtual) loopback MIDI device like <a href="https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html">LoopMIDI</a>. These messages can then be used by a sound system built in Python, Pure-Data or just any MIDI player or editor to play, shape sounds and instruments, or edit songs.

## TO-DO
- [ ] Link the IDE to the interpreter.
- Finish the status bar:
  - [ ] cursor;
  - [ ] lengh;
  - [ ] channels lenghs in beats (from interpreter);
  - [x] alive time;
  - [x] current time.
- [ ] Clean Settings window widgets' definitions
- Finish side buttons actions:
  - [x] close;
  - [x] restart;
  - [ ] open;
  - [ ] new;
  - [ ] save;
  - [ ] run;
  - [x] settings.
- Finish the Settings window:
  - [x] customisation settings;
  - [x] folder settings;
  - [ ] interpreter settings? (output, think about easy command detection insertion in code)
  - [x] clean up bottom part.
